### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Complete the "homework" section of the "my_csv_reader.py" file in this link(), and upload it to your own `class3-homework` Github repo (use either the Boston data or another from the ski-kit learn toy datasets)
*important* : do not import any libraries for this. There are many that can help, but the point of doing it the hard way first is to gain experience, understanding, and appreciation of what they do :)
2. Describe what is a Docker Container (https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), and write 3-4 sentences of your own words when youâ€™d use one, and upload this to the `class3-homework` repository.
3. Install Docker CE (Community Edition) on your personal computers:
Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ 
Windows 10: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Windows 10 Home: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
Mac: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/
You can validate your installation running the command: `docker run hello-world`

##### Advanced
1. Complete [Introduction to Python Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/). You'll need to import the library numpy to do this! (???)
  
##### Reach
1. From your list of python values completed in 1, create a new list for each of the columns in the dataset (i.e. if there are 10 columns/features, extract each feature into its own list, and print them)
