### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Complete the `homework` section of the `my_csv_reader.py` file in this link(https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/class3-hwk), and push it to your own `class3-homework` Github repo (use any dataset from the projects, might need to adjust the script)
*important* : do not import any libraries for this. There are many that can help, but the point of doing it the hard way first is to gain experience, understanding, and appreciation of what they do :)
2. Describe what is a Docker Container (https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), and write 3-4 sentences of your own words when youâ€™d use one, and push this to the `class3-homework` repository in the `docker.txt` or `docker.md` file.
3. Install Docker CE (Community Edition) on your personal computers:
Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ 
Windows 10: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Windows 10 Home: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
Mac: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/
You can validate your installation running the command: `docker run hello-world` and saving the output in the file `docker-installed.txt`. Push it to the `class3-homework` repository too.

##### Advanced
1. Complete [Introduction to Python Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), all modules.
  
##### Reach
1. From your list of python values completed in Basic 1, create a new list for each of the columns in the dataset (i.e. if there are 10 columns/features, extract each feature into its own list, and print them). Ex:

[[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]]

Would become:

[[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]]
