### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Complete the homework section of the my_csv_reader.py file in this link (you can copy the contents from here to start, or use the code you already developed in the class https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/class3-hwk).
Push your final code to your own class3-homework Github repo (use any dataset from the toys datasets, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly) important : do not import any libraries for this. There are many that can help, but the point of doing it the hard way first is to gain experience, understanding, and appreciation of what they do :)
2. Describe what is a Docker Container (https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container), and write 3-4 sentences of your own words when youâ€™d use one, and push this to the `class3-homework` repository in the `docker.txt` or `README.md` file.
3. Install Docker CE (Community Edition) on your personal computers:
Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ 
Windows 10 Pro: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Windows 10 Home or previous version: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
Mac: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/
You can validate your installation running the command: `docker run hello-world` and saving the output of this command in the file `docker-installed.txt`. Push it to the `class3-homework` repository too.

##### Advanced
1. Complete [Introduction to Python Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
  
##### Reach
1. From your list of corrected values completed in Basic 1, intead of printing it to the screen, create a new list called `corrected_list` that should have each one of the corrected rows as a nested list.

A sample of your `corrected_list` should look like this:
`[[0.00632, 18.0, 2.31, 0, 0.538, 6.575, 65.2, 4.09, 1, 296.0, 15.3, 396.9, 4.98, 24.0], [0.02731, 0.0, 7.07, 0, 0.469, 6.421, 78.9, 4.9671, 2, 242.0, 17.8, 396.9, 9.14, 21.6]]`

Now for each of the columns in the list (i.e. if there are 10 columns/features, extract each feature into its own list, and print them, i.e. transpose it). Ex:
```
[[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]]
```
Would become:
```
[[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]]
```
