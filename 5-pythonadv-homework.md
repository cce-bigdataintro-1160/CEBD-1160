### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Create a python script `dataset-processor.py` in the repo `class5-homework`. Your script should:
  * load the dataset
  * organize the data in a table-like format
  * compute and print summary statistics 
  * Visualize the data, 1-feature (column) at a time, i.e. line or histogram and save the figures to files 
  * Visualize the data, 2-features (columns) at a time i.e. scatter plot and save the figures to files
  * Optional: plot as many charts as you want! Why not to loop over all columns plotting multiple charts?
  * The dataset used should be the same dataset you chose for your final project!!!
2. Add a section at the end of your `README.md` explaining me how to run the file.

##### Advanced
1. Add code for adding header data to your table(dataframe) if necessary

##### Reach
1. Add an additional type of plot other than scatterplot (Google to find plot types of interest) for visualizing 2 or more of the features(columns) at a time. Please clearly express either in comments in the code or in your README.md what's the additional plot you chose.

* Recommendation: for all homework, plan to use `matplotlib` for plotting

* Extra challenge: make your `dataset-processor.py` capable of receiving a file name and a header file name as arguments to make it generic for any dataset, take a look at the class4-homework repository, adv_reach lesson for guidance.
