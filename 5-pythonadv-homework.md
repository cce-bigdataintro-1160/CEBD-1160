### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Write Pseudocode in a `README.md` file for how to :
  * load
  * organize the data and headers
  * compute and print summary statistics 
  * Visualize the data, 1-feature (column) at a time, i.e. line or histogram and save the figures to files 
  * Visualize the data, 2-features (columns) at a time i.e. scatter plot and save the figures to files
  * To be submitted by sending me a Github repo called `class5-homework`, with a `README.md` containing the pseudocode
  * Tip: The goal for pseudocode: each step you write should be simple enough that you know how to solve it on its own.

2. Code all of the pseudecode in a script `dataset-processor.py` in the repo `class5-homework`. *The dataset used should be the same dataset you chose for your final project!!!*
3. Add a section at the end of your `README.md` explaining me how to run the file.

##### Advanced
1. Pseudocode for adding header data to your table(dataframe), for an arbitrary one of these datasets
  * To be added on the `README.md` in repo `class5-homework`
2. Code all of the `Advanced Homework` pseudecode and add in `dataset-processor.py`!

##### Reach
1. Pseudocode for an additional type of plot (Google to find plot types of interest) for visualizing 2 or more of the features(columns) at a time.
  * To be added on the `README.md` in repo `class5-homework`
  * Recommendation: plan to use `matplotlib` for plotting
2. Code all of the `Reach Homework` pseudecode and add in `dataset-processor.py`!
