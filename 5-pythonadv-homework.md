### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Write Pseudocode for how to 
  * load
  * "organize"
  * compute summary statistics 
  * Visualize the data, 1-feature (column) at a time, i.e. histogram, and save the figures to files 
  * Visualize the data, 2-features (columns) at a time, i.e. scatter plot, and save the figures to files,
  * To be submitted by sending me a Github repo called `python-adv-homework`, with a `README.md` 
  containing the pseudocode
  * Tip: The goal for pseudocode: each step you write should be simple enough that you know how to solve it on its own.

2. Create a script `dataset-processor.py` in the repo `python-adv-homework`. Add a section at the end of your `README.md` explaining me how to run the file.
3. Code all of the pseudecode!

##### Advanced
1. Pseudocode for adding header data to your table(dataframe), for an arbitrary one of these datasets
  * To be added on the `README.md` in repo `python-adv-homework`
2. Code all of the `Advanced Homework` pseudecode!

##### Reach
1. Pseudocode for an additional type of plot (Google to find plot types of interest) for visualizing 2 or more of the features at a time.
  * To be added on the `README.md` in repo `python-adv-homework`
  * Recommendation: plan to use `matplotlib` for plotting
2. Code all of the `Reach Homework` pseudecode!
