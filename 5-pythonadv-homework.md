### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Write Pseudocode in a `README.md` file for how to :
  * load the dataset
  * organize the data in a table-like format
  * compute and print summary statistics 
  * Visualize the data, 1-feature (column) at a time, i.e. line or histogram and save the figures to files 
  * Visualize the data, 2-features (columns) at a time i.e. scatter plot and save the figures to files
  * To be submitted by sending me a Github repo called `class5-homework`, with a `README.md` containing the pseudocode
  * Optional: plot as many charts as you want! Why not to loop over all columns plotting multiple charts?

2. Code your pseudocode in python code in a script `dataset-processor.py` in the repo `class5-homework`. ***The dataset used should be the same dataset you chose for your final project!!!***
3. Add a section at the end of your `README.md` explaining me how to run the file.

##### Advanced
1. Pseudocode for adding header data to your table(dataframe), to be added on the `README.md` in repo `class5-homework`. 
2. Code your `Advanced Homework` pseudocode in python code and add in `dataset-processor.py`!

##### Reach
1. Pseudocode for an additional type of plot other than scatterplot (Google to find plot types of interest) for visualizing 2 or more of the features(columns) at a time. To be added on the `README.md` in repo `class5-homework`
2. Code your `Reach Homework` pseudecode in python code and add in `dataset-processor.py`!

* Recommendation: for all homework, plan to use `matplotlib` for plotting

* Extra challenge: make your `dataset-processor.py` capable of receiving a file name and a header file name as arguments, take a look at the class4-homework repository, adv_reach lesson for guidance.
