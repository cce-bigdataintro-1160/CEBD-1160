# Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 
* As always, please include instructions for how to run your code in your readme.

# Basic
1. Basic: regenerate a ton of figures (> 50) showing data with at least *3+* features at a time, leveraging things like:
* multiple plots on the same figure
* multiple plots on the same axes
* colours, markers, sizes, shapes, hue, etc...
* 3D visualizations
* use any library you want!

 You can determine how you choose these columns based on conceptual understanding of your dataset, or generating all possible combinations! Push your script and make sure the figures have titles, axis labels, and legends if applicable. (Pushing the images is optional, I recommend pushing the most interesting ones at least)

# Advanced
1. from all your figures, tell me the *greatest* one for interpreting your data, and justify why by explicitly comparing it to some other figures! Write which figure, why and your comparison on your README.MD file.

# Reach
1. return to Docker, and package your script inside a Docker container that can run your script. Add instructions for running your Docker container on the README.MD file. (don't forget the data has to be either copied inside the container or the instructions have to tell me how to mount it using 'volume mounting')

# Bonus reading #
Bonus reading for the week that’ll come up next week: http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html#introduction-problem-settings
In particular, sections `3.6.1` to `3.6.5`. Don’t worry if this is a bit “over your head” right now - it’ll really vary based on your math background and we'll be going through these concepts in the next class.
