# Python Libraries & Numerical Analysis

### Agenda
* Homework Check
* Learning Python Advanced features
* Homework

### Learning Conteinerization with Docker

##### Goals
Get to know a few Python Advanced language constructs that can make your code cleaner and better.

##### Importing Libraries

##### Some useful libraries

matplotlib
seaborn
plotly

Homework to be submitted by sending Greg a Github repo URL, with a `README.md` containing the pseudocode (week 5) and a `.py` file containing the code (week 6) with an update to the `README.md` telling Greg how to run the script.

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 
* As always, please include instructions for how to run your code in your readme.

##### Basic
1. Basic: regenerate a ton of figures (> 50) showing data in *2D or 3D* with at least *4* features at a time, leveraging things like colour, size, shape, etc...  You can determine how you choose these columns based on conceptual understanding of your dataset, or generating all possible combinations! Push your script and figures to Github, and please make sure the figures have titles, axis labels, and legends.

##### Advanced
1. from all your figures, tell me the *best* one for interpreting your data, and justify why by explicitly comparing it to some other figures! :tada:  (for anyone who likes, sports, the :goat: figure... for those who wonder what goat means, it’s ‘greatest of all time’ :upside_down_face:). Submission should be in the form of text in your README.md file that explicitly says the file name within your repo of whatever figure you chose, an explanation of why (in a few sentences), and the mention of a few other figures that you didn’t choose and why.

##### Reach
1. return to Docker, and package your script inside a Docker container that can be run on your data file through *volume mounting*
