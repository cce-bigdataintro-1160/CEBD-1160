### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. make sure all objectives from last homework are completed
2. "refactor" your plotting code to work on the dataset as loaded by `from sklearn.datasets import load_{yourdatasetname}`
3. perform classification/regression (for the question you asked in the first week) on your dataset using KNearestNeighbors Classification or Regression, as applicable, and print the performance. This can be done through the scipy lectures for `scikit-learn` that I linked as bonus reading last week

##### Advanced
1. use *two* other types of classifier/regressors in scikit-learn for answering your question.

##### Reach
1. write basic pseudocode of the classifiers/regressors you're using (more like "math" pseudocode, as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)
