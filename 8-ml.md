# Python Libraries & Numerical Analysis

### Agenda
* Homework Check
* Learning Python Advanced features
* Homework

### Learning Conteinerization with Docker

##### Goals
Get to know a few Python Advanced language constructs that can make your code cleaner and better.

##### SKLearn

sklearn

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. make sure all objectives from last homework are completed
2. "refactor" your plotting code to work on the dataset as loaded by `from sklearn.datasets import load_{yourdatasetname}`
3. perform classification/regression (for the question you asked in the first week) on your dataset using KNearestNeighbors Classification or Regression, as applicable, and print the performance. This can be done through the scipy lectures for `scikit-learn` that I linked as bonus reading last week

##### Advanced
1. use *two* other types of classifier/regressors in scikit-learn for answering your question.

##### Reach
1. write basic pseudocode of the classifiers/regressors you're using (more like "math" pseudocode, as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)

### Optional homework(no need to submit)

### Recommended Readings

### Advanced exercises material

Next week we'll be touching on R a little bit, seeing the differences between it and Python, but mostly as an introduction so that you're aware of it. Your homework between now and the end of the course is essentially to complete your projects, and our last class will include finishing these up so we each have an item to add to your "portfolio" showing what you've learned!

When looking around for things online: always *start simple*! Just because someone somewhere online has "solved" your dataset, it doesn't mean the method is the right thing for _you_ to apply at this stage, if you don't fully understand what it's doing
