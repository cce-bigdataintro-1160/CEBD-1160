## Basic
1. Find a text editor you like! Any text editor should do. A few recommendations are: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Komodo and Vim. 
2. Install `git`/`bash` on your local machine at home, recommended steps here: [Shell Setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html)
3. Install `python`, recommended steps here: [Git Setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/). For Windows, Iâ€™d recommend Option 3 (via Installing it through Anaconda) as it will make future steps much easier.
4. Complete the Software Carpentry Unix lesson send me:???
```$ wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n``` ???

## Advanced
1. Complete Software Carpentry Git lesson as best as you can: [Git Novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). We will plan to spend up to 1 hour in class next week going over `git`, depending on how successful the class is at the following reach challenge.
  
## Reach
1. Be a `git` master! That is, do the following *from scratch*:
  a) create a new repository on Github, with a license and a readme
  b) clone it locally
  c) create a new text file that contains at least 1 line of text
  d) add your file to the repository
  e) commit your changes
  f) edit the README file that came in the repo in some way
  g) commit your changes
  h) push your changes to Github
  i) send me the url for your Github repository
