# Agenda
* Homework Check
* Shell Intro
* Git Intro
* Homework

# Goals
* Establish the foundation for our data analysis by understanding how the Linux shell works:
* * Be able to Navigate through the file system
* * Work with Files and Directories
* * Use gnu core tools and compose them 
* * Write loops and scripts to automate basic processes

* Learn the basics of a versioning control system to enable work organization and collaboration
* * Create a git repository and commit
* * Track changes and see the history of changes
* * Add remotes and push code to GitHub
* * Understand how licensing works

# Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

## Basic
1. Find a text editor you like! Any text editor should do. A few recommendations are: Atom, VisualStudioCode, Sublime, Komodo, and Vim. The first 4 are all regular applications, and Vim is an application that runs in the terminal (it is much more difficult to use, but I have a soft spot for it :slightly_smiling_face:)
2. Fill in this Doodle poll for helping us decide when we’ll make up our 3 hours to the class (in 30-60 min intervals), since class is cancelled on February 23rd:  https://doodle.com/poll/ci9y4ptchudryq6m
3. Install `git`/`bash` and `python` on your local machine at home. I’d recommend following the Software Carpentry guides. For `git`/`bash`, look here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html . For `python`, look here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/ . Note: for Python on Windows, I’d recommend Option 3 (via annaconda) as it will be useful later.
4. Complete the Software Carpentry Unix lesson, and send me a direct message with the output and your explanation for the following command (remember, don’t type the `$`, it just indicates the start of a command):
```$ wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n```
5. (as always, your journal: http://bit.ly/cebd1160_journal )

## Advanced
1. Complete Software Carpentry Git lesson as best as you can: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ . We will plan to spend up to 1 hour in class next week going over `git`, depending on how successful the class is at the following reach challenge.
  
## Reach
1. Be a `git` master! That is, do the following *from scratch*:
  a) create a new repository on Github, with a license and a readme
  b) clone it locally
  c) create a new text file that contains at least 1 line of text
  d) add your file to the repository
  e) commit your changes
  f) edit the README file that came in the repo in some way
  g) commit your changes
  h) push your changes to Github
  i) send @Greg Kiar the url for your Github repository
