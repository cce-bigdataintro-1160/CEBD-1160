# Intro 2 Programming & Big Data

### Agenda
* [Intro Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ea1DruKUHzi632g7h51Vg3uPV6Kv5eka)
* Ensuring our communication on Slack
* [Reviewing Toys Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets)
* Homework

### Goals
* Understand the course format, objectives and grading
* Understand what is Big Data:
  * the ecosystem
  * the main characteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Value
* Be able to recognize a dataset and formulate a question for it  
* Be able to differentiate a regression and classification problem

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. make sure you can access the Slack channels for CEBD-1160! (all the following items should be submitted to me through Slack)
2. create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and make sure to send it to me with your full name
3. Project Kick-Off: pick a dataset from the sklearn toys dataset

##### Advanced
1. formulate a scientific question for your dataset
  
##### Reach
1. write the steps (or make a flowchart) detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it
2. setup your home computer to use shell. the recommended ways to do this in windows:(only one of these steps is necessary!)
2.1 Install git bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.2. Install the WSL (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2.3. Use a VirtualBox image!!! 
   * Install VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/
   * Download the image Ubuntu.ova from this link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-DHx9OHS3F_1pKRaABXhFu_9fJ_3bFs
   * Import the OVA image using the following steps: https://www.maketecheasier.com/import-export-ova-files-in-virtualbox/
   * Launch your virtual environment double clicking on the Ubuntu machine!

### Optional homework
* Research what is an operating system shell/terminal. What's its purpose?
* Research what is a versioning control system. What's its purpose?
