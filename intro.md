# Intro 2 Programming & Big Data

### Agenda
* [Intro Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ea1DruKUHzi632g7h51Vg3uPV6Kv5eka)
* Ensuring our communication on Slack
* [Reviewing Toys Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets)
* Homework

### Goals
* Understand the course format, objectives and grading
* Understand what is Big Data:
  * the ecosystem
  * the main characteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Value
* Be able to recognize a dataset and formulate a question for it  
* Be able to differentiate a regression and classification problem

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. make sure you can access the Slack channels for CEBD-1160! (all the following items should be submitted to me through Slack)
2. create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and make sure to send it to me with your full name
3. Project Kick-Off: pick a dataset from the sklearn toys dataset

##### Advanced
1. formulate a scientific question for your dataset
  
##### Reach
1. write the steps (or make a flowchart) detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it
2. present your dataset, formulated question and proposed solution. Be as detailed as you can
3. setup your home computer to use a shell, a terminal or bash. You can follow these recommended instructions http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html or if you're comfortable try to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
or a VBox with Ubuntu installed.

### Optional homework
* Research what is an operating system shell/terminal. What's its purpose?
* Research what is a versioning control system. What's its purpose?
