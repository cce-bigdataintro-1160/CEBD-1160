# Intro 2 Programming & Big Data

### Agenda
* [Intro Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ea1DruKUHzi632g7h51Vg3uPV6Kv5eka)
* Ensuring our communication on Slack
* [Reviewing Toys Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets)
* Homework

### Goals
* Understand the course format, objectices and grading
* Understand what is Big Data:
  * the ecosystem
  * the main characteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity
* Be able to recognize a dataset and formulate a question for it  
* Be able to differentiate a regression and classification problem

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. make sure you can access the Slack channels for CEBD-1160! (all the following items should be submitted to me through Slack)
2. create a GitHub account and make sure to send it to me with your full name
3. Project Kick-Off: pick a dataset from the sklearn toys dataset

##### Advanced
1. formulate a scientific question for your dataset
   * based on the gender of the Titanic passengers, can we predict the mortality?
   * what's the best feature we can use to predict the cost of a house?
   * if it exists, what is the correlation between the genre of a movie and it's  box office revenue?
  
##### Reach
1. write the steps (or make a flowchart) detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it
2. present your dataset, formulated question and proposed solution
3. setup your home computer to use shell: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html

### Optional homework
* Research what is an operating system shell. What's its purpose?
* Research what is a versioning control system. What's its purpose?
