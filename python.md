### Agenda
* Homework Check
* Intro to Python Data Structures
* Flow Control with conditionals
* Homework

### Intro to Python Data Structures

##### Goals
Get acquainted with the Python language, that we'll use for data exploration and manipulation.

##### Intro to Python Data Structures
1. Get to know numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, booleans, sets and files.
2. Get to know type(), dir() and help() built-in functions
3. Write an equation that uses division, multiplication, an exponent, subtraction and an addition that is equal to 42.5
4. Given the string 'big data' give two commands that return 'd'.
5. Reverse the string 'big data' in two different ways
6. What's the difference between [1,2,3] + [4] and [1,2,3].append(4)
7. Can you replace 'big data' with 'small data' in the list `['a',2,['b',4,5,'big data']]`
8. Find the unique elements in the list [3,333,333,3,3,3333,3,3333,333,3,333333,3]
9. Open and print the titanic train.csv file line by line
10. Can you find the maximum or minimum integer value in a list.
11. Check whether a string is a palyndrome
12. Check if a string is a pangram

##### Flow Control with Conditionals
1. A program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead , and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both print "FizzBuzz"
2. A program that returns the lesser of two numbers if both numbers are odd, but returns the greater one if one or both numbers are even!
3. A program that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to an input number

### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Complete the "homework" section of the "our_csv_parser.py" file in this repository, and upload it to your own Github repo (use either the Boston data or another from the ski-kit learn toy datasets): https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/class3-hwk
*important* point for the Python homework: do not import any libraries for this. There are many that can help, but the point of doing it the hard way first is to gain experience, understanding, and appreciation of what they do :)
2. Learn the Difference between Docker (https://docker.com) and Singularity (https://www.sylabs.io/docs/), and write 3-4 sentences of your own words when youâ€™d use one or the other, and upload this to the same Github repo  as part 1.
3. Install Docker community edition on your personal computers

##### Advanced
1. Complete Introduction to Python Software Carpentry
  
##### Reach
1. From your list of python values completed in 1, create a new list for each of the columns in the dataset (i.e. if there are 10 columns/features, extract each feature into its own list, and print them)

### Optional homework
* What commands we learned are useful for data exploration and why?
* Do a quick research explaining what are the main pros and cons of the Python language.

### Recommended Readings
* [Official Python3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [Python3 Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Python Coding Style Guidelines](Python Coding Style (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))


### Advanced exercises material
* Can you complete these challenges from [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/)
* Learn what git does visually with [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
